This program transforms the data from the Pokemon GO master files
to a better readable & processable JSON file.

![Philosophy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrunnerLivio/pokemongo-json-pokedex/master/.github/philosophy.png)

## Purpose

As a developer it can be in certain situation quite annoying depend on
the raw [GAME MASTER](https://github.com/pokemongo-dev-contrib/pokemongo-game-master) files.
Not only are some informations quite hidden
and must be parsed, the structure of the GAME MASTER files can change
after every version. **pokemongo-json-pokedex** parses the GAME
MASTER data and tries to maintain the same structure, even when the
structure of the source files changed completely.

## Getting Started

const items = require('pokemongo-json-pokedex/output/item.json');

```
